# Improvement

Here are described some improvements that could be added in the future:

## Data structure

### Automobile Usage

- `reason` field could be a `enum` to setup standards and help when filtering data;
- a `reasonDescription` field could be added to complete `reason` with more detailed info.

### Automobile

- `brand` field could be a `enum` to help when filtering data and to ensure only registered brands would be used for automobile entries;
- `color` field could be a `enum` to help when filtering data;
- `licensePlateCountry` field could be added to accept international automobile entries while plate formats could be identified and validated.
